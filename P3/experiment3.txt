Experiment 3 â€“ Time as a Constraint

The modified version when constrained to 1 second had a smaller tree size than
vanilla. This is likely due to the fact that we had to analyze the available
moves during the rollout phase as opposed to just choosing a random one. When
Changing the time constraint to 5 seconds we obtained the same results as well
as when changing it to .5 seconds. We also noticed that the tree size difference
seemed smaller the closer the game came to the end.
